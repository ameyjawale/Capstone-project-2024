(can be treated as a case study)
It contains sales insights and possible sugessions using data driven outcomes for EcomVista
**Background**

 EcomVista is a growing e-commerce company specializing in consumer electronics, apparel,
 and household goods. Operating across multiple regions, the company has seen substantial
 growth in customer acquisition but struggles to translate this growth into profitability and
 sustained market leadership. With vast amounts of data generated daily, EcomVista sought
 to leverage its data for actionable business insights to improve sales performance and
 customer satisfaction.

#**Problem Statement**

EcomVista faced several challenges:
 1.Fragmented Sales Data: Sales data was scattered across regions, products, and
 timeframes, making analysis cumbersome. 
 2.Lack of Actionable Insights: Key metrics such as top-performing products, sales trends,
 and underperforming regions were not easily accessible.
 3.Missed Opportunities: Without a data-driven approach, EcomVista struggled to identify
 areas for revenue growth and operational efficiency.
 
 
**Objective**

 The primary objective was to create a centralized and interactive dashboard using SQL and
 Tableau to:
 1.Analyze and visualize sales trends across different dimensions (regions, products, and
 timeframes).
 2..Provide actionable insights into revenue streams and profitability drivers. 
 3.Enable informed decision-making for sales strategy and operational improvements. 

 
 **Key Deliverables**
 
**Data Integration and Preparation**
 Extract sales data from multiple sources.
 Cleanse and preprocess the data using SQL for efficient analysis.
 
 **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** 
 Create a dynamic dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) like
 total sales, profit margins, and customer demographics.
 Visualize trends such as seasonal sales patterns, top-performing regions, and
 products.
 
 **Sales Insights Report:** 
 Deliver a report highlighting actionable recommendations, such as opportunities for
 cross-selling, region-specific marketing strategies, and inventory optimization.
 
 **Scalability for Future Analysis:**
 Ensure the data model and dashboards are scalable to accommodate new data
 sources and advanced metrics.
 
 **Stakeholder Training:**
 Provide a user manual or training to the EcomVista team for dashboard usage and
 interpretation.
